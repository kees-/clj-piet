# clj-piet

clj-piet is an interpreter for piet (http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

Be aware, a lot of the programs under the "Sample programs" section at the piet site does not work properly as they where made before the clarification on white codels happened and with an interpreter that implemented the white codels differently. This entails that some of the programs will not work with this interpreter.
